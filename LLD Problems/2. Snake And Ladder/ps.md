# Thought process
- Game
  - It has players
  - Board
    - Board has cells
    - Board has snakes and ladders
    - snakes and ladders has start and end cells
  - Next player is choose based on currentPlayer index. currentPlayer++ is done after every turn
    - We can add strategy to choose next player. for ex. skip if bite by snake
  - Player's initial position is fixed. But we can also advance players if they are pro.
    - So, for this also can add strategy
  - At present winning strategy is if position > 100
    - But we can also add winning strategy based on some other. So, for that also strategy pattern can be used
